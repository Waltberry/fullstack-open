# Fullstack Open â€” Workspace

This repo holds my solutions and notes for the University of Helsinki **Fullstack Open** course.

## Prereqs

- Node via **nvm** (use the version in `.nvmrc`)
- Git + GitHub
- VS Code with **Prettier** and **ESLint** extensions

## Quick start

```bash
nvm use # switches to 22.3.0 (or install if missing)
node -v # confirm
```
